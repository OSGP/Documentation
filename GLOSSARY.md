# GXF
Grid eXchange Fabric, formerly known as the Open Smart Grid Platform (OSGP). GXF is an open, generic, scalable and independent 'Internet of Things' platform, which enables various connected smart objects in the public space to be easily controlled and monitored. The GXF project is built using open source tools and standards.

# OSGP
Open Smart Grid Platform, see GXF.

# SSLD
Sub Station Lighting Device, a smart grid device that is used to control and monitor public lighting (several street lights) and tariff switching for an area.

# PSLD
Public Street Lighting Device, a smart grid device that is used to control and monitor a single street light.

# LMD
Light Measurement Device, a smart grid device which uses up to 4 light sensor arrays to determine light or dark for several areas.

# OSLP
Open Street Light Protocol, the protocol used to communicate with SSLD and other smart grid devices.

# IEC61850
IEC 61850 is an international standard defining communication protocols for intelligent electronic smart devices at electrical substations. See [IEC](https://www.iec.ch/smartgrid/standards/)

# MQTT
MQTT stands for MQ Telemetry Transport. It is a publish/subscribe, extremely simple and lightweight messaging protocol, designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks. See [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/)

# DLMS
Device Language Message Specification, the protocol used to communicate with Smart Meters and other smart grid devices.

# COSEM
COmpanion Specification for Energy Metering, defines a set of objects to exchange data with Smart Meters using DLMS protocol.

# DSMR
Dutch Smart Meter Requirements, a set of rules that describe how to use Smart Meters using DLMS/COSOM, defined by Dutch grid operators. For more information [click here](http://www.netbeheernederland.nl/themas/dossier/documenten/?pageindex=7)

# SOAP Webservice
The open smart grid platform offers a Spring Framework SOAP Webservice.
