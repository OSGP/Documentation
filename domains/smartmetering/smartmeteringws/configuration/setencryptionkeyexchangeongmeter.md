# SetEncryptionKeyExchangeOnGMeter

## Description

SetEncryptionKeyExchangeOnGMeter is a request to transfer and set a G-meter key on a G-meter via the E-meter. The request needs the DeviceIdentification from the G-meter. If the device identification of the G-meter is not known, but the gateway device identification and M-Bus channel are known, use the [SetMbusUserKeyByChannel](setmbususerkeybychannel.md) request instead.

All requests have similar response behaviour which is described in [ResponseMessages](../../responsemessages.md).

[GetSetEncryptionKeyExchangeOnGMeterResponse](getsetencryptionkeyexchangeongmeterresponse.md) returns the result from setting a SetEncryptionKeyExchangeOnGMeter. The response contains the DeviceIdentification and CorrelationUid which is received from the SetEncryptionKeyExchangeOnGMeter request.
