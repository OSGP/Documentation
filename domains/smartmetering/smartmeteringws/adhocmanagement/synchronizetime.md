# SynchronizeTime

## Description

SynchronizeTime request synchronizes the date and time on a device. The date and time are retrieved from the server and sent to the device with CLASS\_ID 8, OBIS\_CODE 0.0.1.0.0.255 and ATTRIBUTE\_ID 2. The request is sent with the DeviceIdentification number from the desired device. The request should contain a Deviation of local time to UTC in minutes \(from the range of -720 to 720 inclusive\) and a value Dst indicating whether daylight savings is active. For example in Central European Summer Time, DST is active and times are UTC/GMT +2 hours. For devices in a region where CEST applies, during the summer time the value for deviation should be "-120" \(120 minutes deducted from local time gives GMT/UTC time\) and dst should be "true".

All requests have similar response behaviour which is described in [ResponseMessages](../../responsemessages.md).

[GetSynchronizeTimeResponse](getsynchronizetimeresponse.md) returns the result from synchronizing date and time. The response contains the DeviceIdentification and CorrelationUid which is received from the SynchronizeTime request.
