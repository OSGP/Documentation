### 1.1.1 Functional view

#### Starting architecture

The Functional view shows an overview of the most important functions of the system. The two images below respectively show the starting architecture and functional reference architecture.

1. Web applications
2. Platform (OSGP)
3. Web services
4. Basic functions
5. Database
6. Communication infrastructure (CDMA/GPRS/Ethernet)
7. IP infrastructure
8. Open Street Light Protocol (OSLP)
9. Public Street Lighting Device (PSLD) or Sub Station Lighting Device (SSLD)

### 1.1.2 Functional Reference

This model partitions the system in 7 functional clusters (vertically) which are shown on the system layers (horizontally). The circled numbers refer to image 1.

Vertical clusters:

- Device installation
- Device management
- Firmware management
- Configuration management
- Schedule management
- Ad-hoc control and status
- Monitoring

Horizontal System layers:

- Web applications
- HTTPS/SOAP communication
- Platform
- Open protocols
- Smart devices
