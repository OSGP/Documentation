# Message flow examples

This are some examples how a message flows in the Open Smart Grid Platform.

## Message Flow:  Request/Acknowledge/Poll

![Request/Acknowledge/Poll](../.gitbook/assets/Messageflow-1-poll.png)

| **Step** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | WS adapter receives client soap request with organization certificate and organization id in soap header |
| 2 | WS adapter authenticates organization, checks authorizations and sends request message to domain adapter \(via queue\) |
| 3 | WS adapter returns soap acknowledgement with correlation id |
| 4 | Domain adapter sends request message to core \(via queue\) |
| 5 | Core determines protocol for device and sends request message to protocol adapter \(via queue\) |
| 6 | Protocol adapter translates domain request message, sends request to device and receives response from device |
| 7 | Protocol adapter sends response message to core \(via queue\) |
| 8 | Core forwards response message to domain adapter \(via queue\) |
| 9 | Domain adapter forwards response message to response queue |
| 10 | Client app polls for response using correlation id \(with organization certificate and organization id in soap header\) |
| 11 | WS adapter retrieves response message from response queue |
| 12 | WS adapter sends soap response to client app |

## Message Flow: Request/Acknowledge/Notify

![Request/Acknowledge/Notify](../.gitbook/assets/Messageflow-2-Notify.png)

| **Step** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1-8 | Same as request/acknowledge/poll message flow |
| 9 | Domain adapter forwards response message to WS adapter |
| 10 | WS adapter stores response in DB |
| 11 | WS adapter sends soap notification with correlation id to the client app\* |
| 12 | Client app sends soap request with correlation id to retrieve the response |
| 13 | WS adapter retrieves \(and deletes\) response from DB |
| 14 | WS adapter sends soap response to the client app |

\*In case the response is not timely retrieved by the client app, OSGP will resend the notification with correlation id to the client app. The amount of retries is configurable.
