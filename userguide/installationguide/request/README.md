# Test the Platform

There are two procedures for testing the Open Smart Grid Platform.

1. [SoapUI](testosgp.md). Create and send Soap requests to the Platform to manage a \(simulated\) light.
2. [PublicLighting Demo App](testosgpdemoapp.md). Use the Demo App to send requests to the Platform to manage a \(simulated\) device.
