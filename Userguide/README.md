# CHAPTER 2. User's Guide

Sys Admins who are tasked with keeping the Open Source Grid Platform running on a environment, can find some information in this chapter.

## Get Started

To get started with Open Source Grid Platform, please read our [Introduction](../INTRO.md). The Introduction offers an excellent overview of the Platform and its features.

A next step could be to have a look at the WSDL's to understand which functions are present per functional domain. Depending on the functional domain one is interested in, one could also have a look at the Protocol Adapter and device simulator for the domain.

### Installation

If a full installation is desired, have a look at our [Installation Guide](./Installation/Installationguide.md). This can be used to setup a development environment which can be used to start the Platform and run it. Installation on one or several servers can be derived from the steps within the Installation Script.
