## Users

Soap Requests in the Open Source Grid Platform have fields for an User name and an Application name in the Header. These are only used for logging and auditing. There are no restrictions (e.g. Authorizations) with regard to these fields. However, it is recommended to use names for Logging and Auditing purposes.
