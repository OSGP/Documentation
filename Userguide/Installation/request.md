## Testing the Open Smart Grid Platform

There are two procedures for testing the Open Smart Grid Platform.

1. [SoapUI](./testOSGP.md). Create and send Soap requests to the Platform to manage a (simulated) light.
2. [PublicLighting Demo App](./TestOsgpDemoApp.md). Use the Demo App to send requests to the Platform to manage a (simulated) device.
