##5.2 DLMS/COSEM
The open smart grid platform supports DLMS/COSEM ([IEC 62056](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_62056)]. DLMS/COSEM is a popular protocol to read smart meters. DLMS/COSEM is the defacto standard in Europe.

The open smart grid platform DLMS/COSEM implementation was initial based on SMR5 and [DSMR v4](http://www.netbeheernederland.nl/themas/hotspot/hotspot-documenten/?dossierid=11010056&title=Slimme%20meter&onderdeel=Documenten).
Other types of meters/profiles can be added to the platform. The open smart grid platform implementation supports HLS3/4/5.


###Used library
The [OpenMUC jDLMS library from Fraunhofer](https://www.openmuc.org/dlms-cosem/) is used to implement the protocol.
