## FindEvents request

### Description
FindEvents is a request to retrieve periodic events logging from a device. 
The request needs the DeviceIdentification, EventLogCategory, From and Until DateTime.
The EventlogCategories consist off:
- STANDARD_EVENT_LOG

DSMR Chapter 4.2.1 describes the several events and their description.

All requests have similar response behaviour which is described in [ResponseMessages](./ResponseMessages.md).
