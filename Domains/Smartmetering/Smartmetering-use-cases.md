#### Smart Meter Head-end System

**Technical drivers**

- Replacement or addition to the current head-end system
- During the coming years, many smart meters will be placed in houses, companies and other properties, therefore grid operators need a scalable solution
- E(lectricity) Meters can host up to 4 other smart devices, Gas Meters for example
- DLMS/COSEM is used by many(if not all) Smart Meters

**Customer drivers**

- People will have more insight in their power consumption
- Meter values can be gathered by the grid operator, instead of relying on people reporting the meter values
