#### Reference implementation in The Netherlands:  Flexible system for operating public lighting (FlexOVL)

FlexOVL, a new and flexible switching system of public lighting delivers more control for municipalities and is the first solution which is powered by the Open Smart Grid Platform.

**Technical drivers for Alliander**

- Replacing Ripple Control
- Decrease future investments
- Decrease outages

**Customer drivers (Municipalities)**

- Be more in control, by controlling switching times themselves
- Resolve power failures faster, through up-to-date information
- Reduction in costs, through energy saving and more efficient maintenance and management
- No vendor lock-in, not dependent on one supplier

**Implementation/roll-out**

- Small scale roll-out started January 2015
- 200 Sub Stations will be fitted with an SSLD to control public lighting and tariff switching
- 15 municipalities in the Liander grid operator area will be participating
- Goal is to allow municipalities to use the application, give feedback and to see if the services offered to municipalities are adequate


- Large scale roll-out will start around 2016
- The entire Liander grid operator area will use SSLD's to control all public lighting and tariff switching
- About 25.000 Sub Stations (middenspanningsruimtes)
- About 800.000 street lights will be switched by the SSLD's mounted in the 25.000 Sub Stations

**FlexOVL web application (not open source available)**

Municipalities are free to choose their own (web)application (using the web services of the Open Smart Grid Platform), or they could use the default web application developed by Alliander.

**Functionality of the default  web application as used by grid operator Liander (example)**

- Create switching schedules and assign those schedules to one or more SSLD's
- Create groups of SSLD's in order to be able to assign schedules to many SSLD's at once
- On demand switching of public lighting
- Review current status of an SSLD in order to review public lighting and tariff switching states
- Abilities to monitor power consumption of public lighting (available if the SSLD is fitted with an Electricity Meter)
- Monthly report offering insight into switch moments and power consumption
