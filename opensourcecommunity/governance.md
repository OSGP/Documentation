# Governance

With the open smart grid platform we intend to have the right balance between a benevolent Dictator and a Formal Meritocracy in order to have a balanced decision-making process and to prevent unwanted dictators and everlasting discussions. The basic principle is that decisions are based on consensus. If this decision making process takes too long or a decision is required, the community council has the authority to make a decision. [Grid eXchange Fabric complies with the LF Energy governance](https://www.lfenergy.org/governance/)

The governance and rules should be respected.

## Community council / Technical Steering Committee

The community council consists of 5 members and has the authority to make decisions on all community related subjects.

The community council is responsible for:

* General ambitions, objectives and goals
* Principles and understandings
* Governance and consultation bodies
* Guidelines and procedures and tool selection
* Contribution \(process\) of individual members
* Architectural and \(development\) infrastructure choices
* Raise subjects/issues that are important for the direction/development of the community

When the community grows, members of the community council can be elected. If the situation demands or requires it, the community council has the ability to establish sub councils for a specific subject, area of domain.

The community council consist of the following members:

* [Robert Tusveld](https://github.com/rtusveld) - Lead Architect - Chairman 
* [Maarten Mulder](mailto:maarten.mulder@alliander.com) - Product owner GXF & LF Energy TAC member for GXF
* [Paul Houtman](https://github.com/phoutman) - Lead Architect
* [Kevin Smeets](https://github.com/kevinsmeets) - Maintainer 
* [Jonas van den Bogaard](https://github.com/Jonasvdbo) - OSPO team member & LF Energy TAC member for Alliander

If you would like to join the community council, please contact us! Mention @OSGP/communitycouncil in an github issue. The \(online\) community council meetings will happen when needed.
