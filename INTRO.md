## Introduction to Grid eXchange Fabric \(GXF\)

Grid eXchange Fabric was formerly known as the Open Smart Grid Platform \(OSGP\). GXF is an open, generic, scalable and independent 'Internet of Things' platform, which enables various connected smart objects in the public space to be easily controlled and monitored. Our platform allows the use of any \(web\)application and with any IP communication infrastructure.

Our goal is to stimulate the development of smart and sustainable solutions. Smart devices and smart apps play a central role in the development of smart grids and smart societies. The open smart grid platform software enables you to connect to thousands of devices, control them, and monitor their performance. This is done in an open and secure way, so you can use it for your own applications and devices, thereby reducing the time to market and decreasing development costs.

**`The names Open Smart Grid Platform and Grid eXchange Fabric will both be found in this document and in the code. In the future we will replace all references to the Open Smart Grid Platform and OSGP by Grid eXchange Fabric and GXF. During this transition period please read Grid eXchange Fabric if you see Open Smart Grid Platform.`**

**Using the platform**

The Grid eXchange Fabric is used in the following way:

* A user or operator uses one or more \(web\) applications to monitor and/or control devices
* The applications connect to the open smart grid platform via several web services which are divided into functional domains, i.e. Public Lighting, Smart Metering, Power Quality, etc. Third party developers can use the web services  for the development or integration of new applications
* The platform handles all these application requests in a secure way and uses various functions and services to do so \(e.g. authorization, authentication, device management, logging\)
* For the 'translation' and communication of user/operator commands to the various smart devices, the platform uses multiple \(open\) protocols
* The platform supports various IP based data telecommunication technologies and protocols to communicate with the devices

More technical and user information about Grid eXchange Fabric can be found in this document. More generic/product information about Grid eXchange Fabric can be found on the [Grid eXchange Fabric website](https://www.lfenergy.org/projects/gxf/).
