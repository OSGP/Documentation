## 3.2 Communication and Contact

We choose the GitHub issues feature for most of our communication. This keeps the communication central and topic central. For issues and bugs, please use our GitHub issue list, we are currently actively developing the Open Smart Grid Platform, so your message will be detected in no-time. 

If you want to get in touch to discuss to discuss non-technical subjects, send us an email to our temporary email address at opensource@smartsocietyservices.com. Once we get the foundation going, we will open an address so you can directly contact one of the foundation's employees.

2. A developer can take on the issue and start working on it on voluntary base. If you need this feature and you have the money to pay for it, you can hire a developer and have the developer work on it. If OSGP core components are involved, please discuss your change first with one of the developers/maintainers.

3. The developer makes a description on how he wants to fix the problem. Other developers can discuss the solution as well. If everybody agrees on the solution direction, the developer codes the solution and submits it (by sending in a pull request). The developer should also document the feature in the [GitBook](https://github.com/OSGP/Documentation/tree/development)

4. The maintainer can check the code (or assign this to someone else) and merge it with upstream releases.
