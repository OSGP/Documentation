## Communication and Contact

We choose [Jira](https://smartsocietyservices.atlassian.net/projects/OC/issues/) for most of our development communication. This keeps the communication central and topic central and connect to development effort. 
Please use [Jira](https://smartsocietyservices.atlassian.net/projects/OC/issues/) for issues and bugs. 

If you want to get in touch to discuss to discuss non-technical subjects, send us an email opensource@smartsocietyservices.com or open an [issue on Github](https://github.com/OSGP/documentation/issues/new?title=Question%20:My%20Title&body=**Question:**%0A%0A**background:**%0A%0A**). 
Once we get the foundation going, we will open an address so you can directly contact one of the foundation's employees.

## Jira

Jira was chosen due to its extensive features. The current [Jira](https://smartsocietyservices.atlassian.net/projects/OC/issues/) board is sponsored by Smart society services for synergy reasons. 
Once we have multilple contributors outside Smart society services we can move to a dedicated jira instance or something else.

Once you get actively involved, you can request write permissions on the jira board.
You can request write access to the Jira issue board by sending a request to marcel.van.hal<at>smartsocietyservices.com and a copy to opensource@smartsocietyservices.com (if Marcel is not available).

### New Features

1. If there is a need (or wish!) for a new feature, add it as issue to [Jira](https://smartsocietyservices.atlassian.net/projects/OC/issues/) as a user story. Please provide a full description about the background of the problem. Spilt-up big userstories in multiple small user stories.

2. A developer can take on the issue and start working on it on voluntary base. If you need this feature and you have the money to pay for it, you can hire a developer and have the developer work on it. If open smart grid platform core components are involved, please discuss your change first with one of the developers/maintainers.

3. The developer makes a description on how he wants to fix the problem. Other developers can discuss the solution as well. If everybody agrees on the solution direction, the developer codes the solution and submits it (by sending in a pull request). The developer should also document the feature in the [GitBook](https://github.com/OSGP/Documentation/tree/development)

4. The maintainer can check the code (or assign this to someone else) and merge it with upstream releases.

### Bug tracking

1. Find out as much as possible about the bug before reporting it. Please check on GitHub whether the bug has already been reported. Also, look for logs, error messages etc. Please include as much information as possible background on the bug. 
2. The maintainer makes sure that somebody will look at the bug, check for duplicates and thank the contributor for sending in the bug. If the bug turns out to be a duplicate, the issue will be closed.
3. A developer will try to reproduce the bug and will look for the root cause. The developer adds his findings to the issue. If the developer cannot reproduce the bug, the developer will contact the user for more information or/and login into the user's system (when possible for the user/developer). If it's impossible to re-produce the bug, the issue will be closed.
4. Otherwise, the developer will write a patch and tests the fix.
5. Once the patch is accepted (see Code review/test process), it will be shipped with the next release.
6. The maintainer than closes the issue.
