## 4.5 Contributing to documentation

Our most recent documentation can be found [here](http://54.77.62.182/documentation/) The documentation is build using GitBook software from Markdown files in the [documentation repository](https://github.com/OSGP/Documentation). 

We encourage you to participate in improving the documentation. From corrected typos to new sections, every commit is appreciated. You can access the source files by clicking the "Fix this page"-button in the GitBook or by selecting the relevant Markdown-file in the documentation. You can commit your changes by sending a pull request.

### 4.5.1 Chapters in the documentation

### 4.5.2 Versioning within the documentation

We have chosen to work with GitBook since it allows us to make different versions of documentation for each release. This is done by branching the files in the documentation repository. The master branch is used for releases only. The development branch is our main and current branch. If you like to improve the documentation, start a feature branch with your changes and send a pull request to the development branch.

### 4.5.3 Guidelines for new documentation

- The master branch is only used by major OSGP releases
- Don't commit directly to the development branch, please do a pull request.
- We use the American spelling
- Please follow the used chapter and section numbering and apply it in your commits as well
- Currently we do not use image numbering, since it is too much of a hassle to keep it up-to-date. If you have a smart idea to do this, let us know! 
- Give your (sub) document a relevant name or section with number
- Update SUMMARY.md if needed
