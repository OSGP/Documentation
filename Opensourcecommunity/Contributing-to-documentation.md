### Versioning within the documentation

We have chosen to work with GitBook since it allows us to make different versions of documentation for each release. This is done by branching the files in the documentation repository. The master branch is used for releases only. The development branch is our main and current branch. If you like to improve the documentation, start a feature branch with your changes and send a pull request to the development branch.

### Guidelines for new documentation

- The master branch is only used by major open smart grid platform releases
- Don't commit directly to the development branch, please do a pull request.
- We use the American spelling
- Please follow the used chapter and section numbering and apply it in your commits as well
- Currently we do not use image numbering, since it is too much of a hassle to keep it up-to-date. If you have a smart idea to do this, let us know!
- Give your (sub) document a relevant name or section with number
- Update SUMMARY.md if needed
