## Governance

With the open smart grid platform we intend to have the right balance between a benevolent Dictator and a Formal Meritocracy in order to have a balanced decision-making process and to prevent unwanted dictators and everlasting discussions. The basic principle is that decisions are based on consensus. If this decision making process takes too long or a decision is required, the community council has the authority to make a decision.

The governance and rules should be respected.

### Community council
The community council consists of 5 members and has the authority to make decisions on all community related subjects.

The community council is responsible for:
* General ambitions, objectives and goals
* Principles and understandings
* Governance and consultation bodies
* Guidelines and procedures and tool selection
* Contribution (process) of individual members
* Architectural and (development) infrastructure choices
* Raise subjects/issues that are important for the direction/development of the community

When the community grows, members of the community council can be elected. If the situation demands or requires it, the community council has the ability to establish sub councils for a specific subject, area of domain. One member (seat) represents the Open Smart Grid Platform Foundation (once started) for alignment between the objectives of the foundation and the direction of the development of the online community.

The community council consist of the following members:
* [Sander Jansen](https://github.com/Sander3003) - Open source consultant - Chairman 
* [Paul Houtman](https://github.com/phoutman) - Lead Architect
* [Kevin Smeets](https://github.com/kevinsmeets) - Maintainer 
* Vacancy
* Vacancy - Open Smart Grid Platform foundation seat

If you would like to join the community council, please contact us! Mention @OSGP/communitycouncil in an github issue.
The (online) community council meetings will happen when needed.

###Maintainers
Maintainers are responsible for maintaining parts of the code-base. Maintainers have the following responsibilities
* Coordinate development activity
* Make sure code/documentation reviews are being done
* Coordinate pull-requests
* Coordinate bug follow-ups
* Coordinate questions

In case of long discussions or arguments, maintainers or other can request a community council decision.

Current maintainers:
* Open smart grid platform and smart lighting domain: [Kevin Smeets](https://github.com/kevinsmeets)
* Smart metering domain: [Bart van der Zwet](https://github.com/bvdzwet)
* Documentation & configuration: [Ruud Lemmers](https://github.com/rlemmers)

@Sander3003 will track new Github issues and assign them to maintainers and inform them (via a Jira ticket).
