Component overview

## 3.2 Development Guide per Component

### 3.2.1 Web Service Adapters

The web service adapters use Spring Web Service, contract first. JAXB is used to generate Java classes from the XSD's. All SOAP operations are bound to an endpoint. The incoming SOAP requests are authenticated by organization identification (plus certificates). Organization authorizations are checked for the desired operation. If the request is OK, a JMS message is sent to a domain adapter component.

### 3.2.2 Domain Adapters

Domain adapters contain business logic and persistence. Domain adapters process and forward the JMS message to the Core component.

### 3.2.3 Domain Components

Domain components contain entities and value objects.

### 3.2.4 Core

The Core component routes messages from domain adapter components to protocol adapter components and vice versa. Furthermore, it offers read-only database access for protocol adapter components.

### 3.2.5 Protocol Adapters

Protocol Adapter components translate a message from domain adapter components into a protocol message for a smart device. Protocol Adapter components send the protocol message to a smart device using a network connection. The response from the smart device is translated into a domain response message which will be sent to the Core components (which will route it to the domain adapter which issued the request).

#### 3.2.5.1 OSLP

For the OSLP implementation, 2 components are used. The first component is the protocol adapter for the protocol. It can translate message into the protocol message for SSLD's. Second there's the signing-server component. It is responsible for signing the protocol message using the private key of the platform. The components communicate using a queue-pair. The singing-server can handle multiple protocol adapter instances by utilizing a reply-to queue per protocol adapter instance. Since the protocol adapter component needs to be reachable from a network, it is a requirement that the private key may not be used by the protocol adapter directly. The singing-server component  can be deployed in such a way that no network access is available to this component, as the only coupling needed are the queues / the message broker.

#### 3.2.5.2 DLMS

The DLMS implementation is work in progress.

#### 3.2.5.2 61850

The 61850 implementation is work in progress.
