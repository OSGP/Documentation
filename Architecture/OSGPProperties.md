## Properties of the Open Smart Grid Platform

The open smart grid platform is designed for message based communication.
- Acts as a **connecting link** between (web)applications and smart devices
- The open Source approach **prevents vendor lock-in** 
- State of the art **security** 
- Fully **scalable,** dynamically scaling up and down as more devices and applications are added.
- Freedom of choice in the **desired IP communication infrastructure** , e.g. CDMA and GPRS.
- Stimulates open innovation by using **open standards** and **open source** technology
- **Multiple devices** and communication protocols are supported
- **Independent** of (cloud) hosting infrastructure
- By delinking the chain and the use of open standards and the open source license, everybody can build their applications on top of the open smart grid platform.
- The open smart grid platform is **designed** to provide reliable and efficient delivery of command and control information for e.g. [smart meters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_meter), direct [load control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_control) modules, [solar panels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panels), gateways and other applications.
- The open smart grid platform simplifies the implementation of smart devices resulting in a shorter time-to-market by having built-in **device management** features
- The platform supports various IP data communication infrastructures to communicate with the devices (internet, lan, GPRS, CDMA, UMTS, etc.).
- The open smart grid platform also supports authentication and encryption for all data exchanges to protect the integrity and privacy of data as required in e.g. the smart grid.
- The open smart grid platform Supports **multiple protocols**
- **Easy application integration** by abstracting the device complexibility with webservices can could be used for many devices.
- Supports **active-active** setup over multiple datacenters
- Adding servers can be done in **runtime**
 
Please note: the Open Smart Grid Platform is not build for streaming data such as video, audio or a stream of high frequency measurement data.

### Unique features of the Open Smart Grid Platform

The Open Smart Grid Platform is unique by its multi-dimensional, generic and open design. Because of a true separation of layers and the use of open standards, other suppliers and/or third parties are able to develop and market innovative solutions.

1. The platform is **multidimensional**. This means that several customer use cases (with separate business models) are able to use the various device functions. One single application could use the same function of different devices. 
2. The **generic** design ensures that the platform can be used in a flexible way for several functions and applications (e.g. public lighting services and smart meter services).
3. The platform is aimed at the **'common parts'** of the technology chain; suppliers or vendors (of both applications and devices) have no competitive advantage in delivering these kind of services.
4. The platform layers are truly separated by open standards and the platform is made available as **open source** software.
5. The  platform does not hold on to any application data ( **stateless** ). No messages/commands will ever get lost.
This enables third party vendors and developers to deliver innovative applications which are competitive in both rich functionalities and the generated data.
